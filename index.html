    <h1>The Stars Above the Whispering Tree</h1>

    <p>
      Once upon a time, in a quiet little village where the wind sang lullabies and the moon smiled down gently every night, there was a girl who had the warmest heart in the whole land. Her name was <strong>Aya</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      She laughed like sunshine and loved with all her heart—especially her father, Loyloy. Loyloy wasn’t just her dad—he was a gentle giant of kindness, with eyes like calm lakes and a voice that made even storms quiet down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every night before bed, he would tell Aya a story. He told her about the Whispering Tree, a glowing tree that grew on the highest hill and held the dreams of every child in the village.
    </p>

    <p>
      “One day,” he told her, “if you ever feel lost or lonely, just close your eyes and go to the Whispering Tree. I’ll be there, waiting.”
    </p>

    <p>
      One day, Loyloy had to leave—not to another village, but to a place beyond the clouds. Aya was heartbroken. The world seemed quieter, like it had lost its music.
    </p>

    <p>
      That night, when she finally fell asleep, she dreamed. In her dream, she walked barefoot under a glowing sky. The stars above whispered her name. There stood the Whispering Tree—and under it, her father.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Papa?” she whispered.  
      Loyloy smiled, arms wide. “You found me, just like I said.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “I miss you,” she said.  
      “I miss you too,” he replied, hugging her. “But I’m always with you. Just look up at the stars—that’s where I’ll be.”
    </p>

    <p>
      From that night on, every time she closed her eyes, the stars danced a little brighter. And under the Whispering Tree, her father Loyloy was always waiting.
